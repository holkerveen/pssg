# Welcome to the PSSG homepage

*PSSG* stands for *PHP Static Site Generator* and is inspired by the great [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator.

# Requirements

PHP with the *inotify* extension installed, composer

## Quick start

Below instructions show a basic setup requiring just [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). It will install *PSSG* in your home folder. Skip to *Using Docker* if you are in to that!

```shell script
git clone git@github.com:holkerveen/pssg ~/.pssg
cd ~/.pssg
composer install
cd -

ln -s ~/.pssg/bin/pssg /usr/local/bin/pssg
mkdir -p /path/to/your-project-dir
cd /path/to/your-project-dir
echo "# Welcome" >> /path/to/your-project-dir/index.md
pssg --serve --watch /path/to/your-project-dir
```

Then, start writing! The pssg command will start a development server and will recompile and reload your site on any change. As an example and test case, this document is part of a documentation website generated by the PSSG.

## Using Docker

### Run the example

```shell script
git clone git@github.com:holkerveen/pssg
cd pssg
docker-compose run composer install
mkdir your-project-dir
echo "# Welcome" >> your-project-dir/index.md
docker-compose run pssg serve your-project-dir
```

### Run your own site

If you wanna go real fancy, you can use our `docker-compose.yml` file to start a new project. You would not need a local PHP or composer install for that. You do need docker though.

```shell script
git clone git@github.com:holkerveen/pssg
cd pssg
docker-compose run composer install
mkdir your-project-dir
echo "# Welcome" >> your-project-dir/index.md
docker-compose run pssg serve your-project-dir
```
